# Connect 4 ![alte text](https://github.com/Thanasis-Traitsis/Connect_4/blob/main/img/icon2.png)
This is the first project that I have worked on as a student. Connect Four is a two-player connection board game, in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored tokens into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own tokens
